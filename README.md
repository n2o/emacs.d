# Emacs.d 

This is my personal .emacs.de config focused on Clojure development. I use it on a Mac with US Keyboard-Layout.

I used a config originally created by Ryan Neufeld (https://gist.github.com/rkneufeld/5126926)

# Changes

- German Umlauts are accessible via M-a, M-u and M-o
- Added Yasnippets
- smex is triggered via either M-x, M-z or s-3 (s is CMD on a Mac)
- dirtree is triggered using s-1
- Shit-Arrows navigate between frames
- fn is shown as a lambda symbol rather than f
