# Emacs.d 

I am using a german Mac Keyboard Layout and edited some little changes to fit better to a Mac.

This configuration was forked from [bendisposto](http://www.github.com/bendisposto/emacs.d) with a very good Clojure support. But some changes are needed to better fit to a german keyboard layout.

He used a config originally created by Ryan Neufeld (https://gist.github.com/rkneufeld/5126926).

# Changes

- Use smooth scrolling line by line for better usage with the Macbook Pro's Touchpad
- Use the CMD button as the META button
- German Umlauts are accessible via M-a, M-u and M-o
- Added Yasnippets
- smex is triggered via either M-x, M-z or s-3 (s is CMD on a Mac)
- dirtree is triggered using s-1
- Shift-Arrows navigate between frames
- fn is shown as a lambda symbol rather than f
